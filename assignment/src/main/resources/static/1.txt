first we create mongodb database and made a connection with my server,and then we made routes

this project follows client-server architicture. In this project for the better communication among all clients we need socket.io library 
that helps to build a reliable communication link.

i also used peer.js that help all clients to share there video and audio between them.

Express : It is the server-based framework for node.js

uuid module: This module is used to generate a unique id. This will be used in this project 


implementation : 
 
1st step : create server.js file and write basic code for srver initialization
2nd step : import socket.io library and add into server.js file
3 : add a ejs file that help in to show frontend
4 : for generating a unique id, i need to implement some code, because whenever i want to host a meeting then i need a meeting key id and
	the password associated with it.

Let’s Implement the main function of this app – 
Now we are going to take users audio, video streams and send that stream to another client. For this, we are going to use WebRTC here.

Real-time applications(Instant messenger, Online gaming, push notification etc), on the other hand, are those applications which run within a given time-slot such that user is presented with immediate and up-to-date copy of the resource. 

Socket.IO is one such JavaScript library that programmers use in developing real-time “Web Applications”.

Socket.IO works on the same concept and enables bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. For handling them separately and efficiently, it consists of two parts;
	a JavaScript client library that runs on browsers.
	a Node.js server
